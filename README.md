# Surfs Up

## Overview

In this analysis we sought to have a better understanding of temperatures and precipitation in the months of June and December from 2010 to 2017.  The purpose of looking at this data was to understand the viability of opening a surf shop.  The concept behind looking at June and December is to capture the opposite seasons for comparison. 

## Results

*  Temperature Avg.
   *  Jun > 74.9
   *  Dec > 71.0
*  Temperature (Min/Max)
   *  Jun > 64/85
   *  Dec > 56/83
*  Precipitation Avg.
   *  Jun > .14
   *  Dec > .22
*  Cumulative Stats
   *  Temperature
      *  73.1
   *  Precipitation
      *  .16

## Summary

- As we can see from the average temperatures, they hold above 70 in both months.  When we average the entire dataset the average remains above 70 indicating warm temperatures year long
- Precipitation is less during the month of June with it increasing by 58% in December.  When compared to the entire dataset the average is .16.  Based on looking at the December spike, we can assume there will be less surfing days in December than June.


Overall, the cumulative stats for the dataset are in line with the the averages of the summer temperature and precipication of June.  With 7 years of data and minor fluctuations in December, the viability of a surf/ice cream shop is positive.
